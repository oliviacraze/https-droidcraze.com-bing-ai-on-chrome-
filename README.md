# [Bing AI on Chrome](https://droidcraze.com/bing-ai-on-chrome/)
Bing AI is a chatbot powered by GPT-4 technology that allows users to chat with Bing and get various responses and content. It is currently only available on Microsoft Edge, but there are a few ways to access it on Google Chrome.
One way is to use the Bing Chat for All Browsers extension. This extension automatically switches the user agent on that tab to Microsoft Edge, allowing you to use Bing AI on Chrome.

Another way to access Bing AI on Chrome is to change your user agent string to Microsoft Edge. You can do this yourself through DevTools, or you can use a service like User-Agent Switcher.
